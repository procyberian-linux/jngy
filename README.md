# jngy

jngy

When I search on Google this string expression "jngy" i have found

"jung name origin"

"jay name origin"

"joy name origin"

"jenny name origin"

I know "ng" name from the movie "Aloha", I was playing with words, and jngy seems interesting to me.

Those meaninings are all fine like :

Jay : Win or Victory
Joy : Great Pleasure
Jenny(Jennifer) : fair one
Jung : Young

I plan a software platform so I need to use that name both for a code name for a d覺str覺but覺on called "procyber覺an" or for an application.

Thanks and happy hacking!
